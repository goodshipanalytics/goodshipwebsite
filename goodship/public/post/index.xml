      <description>Charities often recieve a large number of single donations from indivudals. Fundraisers will follow up to see if the individual would like to make a repeating donation. The large number of single donations makes following up with each individual prohibtive and so a statistical model has been developed to determine what donor characteristics are most likely to lead to a repeat donation. This allows the fundraiser to priortize their follow-ups and therfore maximise the likelihood of contacting individuals who are interesting in commiting to a repeating donation.</description>
