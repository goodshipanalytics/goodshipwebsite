title: "Identifying Repeat Donors for Charities"
---

Charities often recieve a large number of single donations from
indivudals. Fundraisers will follow up to see if the individual would
like to make a repeating donation. The large number of single
donations makes following up with each individual prohibtive and so a
statistical model has been developed to determine what donor
characteristics are most likely to lead to a repeat donation. This
allows the fundraiser to priortize their follow-ups and therfore
maximise the likelihood of contacting individuals who are interesting
in commiting to a repeating donation.

Good Ship Analytics used a database of donor characteristics provided
by the client and applied machine learning algorthims for variable
selection to determine what characteristics are the most
influential. The models are used to estimate, conditional on the donor
characteristics, the probability of a repeate donation. Prospective
donors are then priortized by their estimated probability.
